# SwitchElement
Simple, mostly stolen script from one of pr in official gc, which allows to quickly change traveller element.<br>
Original pr: https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/pull/1287 <br>
I just added dendro and changed it to plugin.

## Usage
Use /se <element> or /switchelement <element> <br>
Elements: white/anemo/geo/electro/dendro
white = no element
For dendro you need to have:
1. Genshin 2.8.5 beta
2. Grasscutter supporting that version
3. Dendro files from Endg4me_#7769 (<a href='https://discord.com/channels/997259363158859786/997566696137175144/998975316779356231'>From here if you're in Frontrooms</a>)


### Issues

I know that descriptions are missing, don't use issues on github, I promise that I'll fix that

### Version
The plugin is based on plugin template from Grasscutters GitHub.

#### Also this code is ugly, don't look, it's my first time trying things is java
