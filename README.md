# SwitchElement
Simple, mostly stolen script from one of pr in official gc, which allows to quickly change traveller element.<br>
Original pr: https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/pull/1287 <br>
I just added dendro (not this version, ask dm Penelopeep#7963) and changed it to plugin.

## Usage
Use /se <element> or /switchelement <element> <br>
Elements: white/anemo/geo/electro
white = no element

### Issues

I know that descriptions are missing, don't use issues on github, I promise that I'll fix that

### Version
The plugin is based on plugin template from Grasscutters GitHub.

#### Also this code is ugly, don't look, it's my first time trying things is java
