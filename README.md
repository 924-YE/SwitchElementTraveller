# SwitchElement
Simple, mostly stolen script from one of pr in official gc, which allows to quickly change traveller element.<br>
Original pr: https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/pull/1287 <br>
I just changed it to plugin.

## Usage
Use /se <element> or /switchelement <element> <br>
Elements: white/anemo/geo/electro <br>
white = no element <br><br>


### Version
The plugin is based on plugin template from Grasscutters GitHub.

#### Also this code is ugly, don't look, it's my first time trying things is java
