# SwitchElement
Simple, mostly stolen script from one of pr in official gc, which allows to quickly change traveller element.<br>
Original pr: https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/pull/1287 <br>
I just added dendro and changed it to plugin. <br>
Credits to hartie95#8966 for amazing help with rewriting code

## Usage
Use /se <element> or /switchelement <element> <br>
Elements: white/anemo/geo/electro/dendro <br>
white = no element <br><br>
For dendro you need to have:
1. Genshin 2.8.5 beta
2. Grasscutter supporting that version


## Building
I don't know why would you want to build it but:
1. Download maven from apache website
2. Open command prompt/powershell in your project folder (Sorry Linux and MacOS users, you'll need to find your own way for this)
3. Run <b>mvn package</b>
4. Now jar file should be in new target folder


### Version
The plugin is based on plugin template from Grasscutters GitHub.

#### Also this code is ugly, don't look, it's my first time trying things is java
